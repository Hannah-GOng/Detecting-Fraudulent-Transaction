# Detecting-Fraudulent-Transaction

As credit card become an integral part of our daily life, credit card safety becomes an important issue to consumers. Credit card companies need to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions accurately so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 

The objective of this study is to build models featuring 28 principal components obtained with PCA and amount to identify a certain transaction is fraudulent or genuine. 

Three modeling techniques were considered: Neural Network models, k-nearest neighbor models, and generalized boosted regression models. According to the result, we find the "best" model among those three is the generalized boosted regression model because they have the highest true positive rate (0.8772) on detecting fraudulent transaction.
